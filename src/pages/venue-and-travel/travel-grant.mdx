## Contribute to travel grant
While fund for travel grant comes from sponsorships from corporates and ticket fees income, 
We often found it's not enough to sponsor travel of enough number of participants especially those who contributes a lot to the event such as event organizers and speakers.

Thus, we encourage individuals like you to contribute to our event fund by donating amount of money you want.
Your financial contributions will enable us to gather more diverse people from Ubuntu and FOSS Community across Asia which is one of our important goals.
To apreciate your finaicial contribution, Your name will be featured on "Become a patron" page.
